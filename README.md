# corbs-dots-1.0
This is just a repository for my messy mashup of dotfiles that I've either wrote myself or snagged from other people. Do with it what you like :]

# REQUIREMENTS
You're going to need picom-git, nm-applet, pa-applet-git, ttf-jetbrains-mono, ttf-font-awesome, ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols, and lain-git for these dotfiles to work as intended.
Optionally, I do recommend having a matching gruvbox gtk theme to pair with these dotfiles.
