Be aware that…
-----------
…this project is not developed any longer, nor do I use awesome.  It still
works though \o/. I am willing to merge bug fixes and improvements that do not
alter the appearance or behavior. Breaking changes in this sense, I will not
merge.

You are welcome to fork APW and I will add a link to it in the README.

Awesome Pulseaudio Widget
=========================

Awesome Pulseaudio Widget (APW) is a little widget for
[Awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), using the awful progressbar widget
to display default's sink volume and control Pulseaudio.

It's compatible with Awesome 4.0.

First time I'm using Lua so it might be a little bit quirky.

Get it
------

```sh
cd $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/
git clone https://github.com/mokasin/apw.git
```

Use it
------

Just put these line to the appropriate places in
*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/rc.lua*.

```lua
-- Load the widget.
local APW = require("apw/widget")

-- Example: Add to wibox. Here to the right. Do it the way you like it.
right_layout:add(APW)

-- Configure the hotkeys.
awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioRaiseVolume",  APW.Up),
awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioLowerVolume",  APW.Down),
awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioMute",         APW.ToggleMute),

```

Customize it
------------

### Theme

*Important:* `beautiful.init` must be called before you `require` apw for
theming to work.

Add these variables to your Beautiful theme.lua file and set them to whatever
colors or gradients you wish:

```lua
--{{{ APW
theme.apw_fg_color = {type = 'linear', from = {0, 0}, to={40,0},
	stops={{0, "#CC8888"}, {.4, "#88CC88"}, {.8, "#8888CC"}}}
theme.apw_bg_color = "#333333"
theme.apw_mute_fg_color = "#CC9393"
theme.apw_mute_bg_color = "#663333"
--}}}

```

### Directly edit widget.lua

You also can customize some properties by editing the configuration variables
directly in `widget.lua` (for example to add a margin).
It is advisable to customize the source file in a separate branch. This makes
it easy to update to a new version of APW via rebasing.

### Overriding hidden widget properties without directly editing widget.lua

`.pulseBar` and `.pulse` widget properies allowing to directly
override some widget behavior or properties which are not customizeable
by `beautiful` theme variables.

```lua
  local volume = require("third_party/apw/widget")
  
  -- adjust progress bar step:
  volume.pulseBar.step = 0.02
  
  -- set Scroll Lock LED on keyboard to show Mute status:
  volume.pulse.OrigToggleMute = volume.pulse.ToggleMute
  volume.pulse.ToggleMute = function(self)
      volume.pulse.OrigToggleMute(self)
      if volume.pulse.Mute then
        awful.spawn.spawn('xset led named "Scroll Lock"')
      else
        awful.spawn.spawn('xset -led named "Scroll Lock"')
      end
  end
```


Mixer
----

Right-clicking the widget launches a mixer. By default `pavucontrol` is used,
but you may use a different mixer by calling SetMixer() on your APW object:

```lua
local APW = require("apw/widget")
APW:SetMixer("mixer_command -whatever")
```

### Tip
In order to track changes to the volume from outside the widget, it is possible
to update the widget periodically.

```lua
APWTimer = timer({ timeout = 0.5 }) -- set update interval in s
APWTimer:connect_signal("timeout", APW.Update)
APWTimer:start()
```
